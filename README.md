# Attendance-System-by-Face-Recognition
An automatic Attendance System using the face recognition system

# PROJECT SUMMARY
<pr>The Facial Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based software application that automates the attendance process using computer vision techniques. It uses a webcam to detect and recognize faces in real-time, matching them against a trained database of student images. On successful recognition, the system logs the student's attendance, including the date and time, into a CSV file and optionally stores it in a MySQL database for further analysis or reporting. <pr/>

<pre>The system is built with the following core technologies:<b> 
=> Python as the programming language. 
=> OpenCV for face detection and recognition. 
=> Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). 
=> MySQL for database management. 
=> Pillow (PIL) for image processing. <pre/>

The system provides six main modules through its GUI: 
<br>=> Student Management – Register student details and capture photo samples. 
<br>=> Dataset Training – Train the facial recognition model using the captured images. 
<br>=> Face Recognition – Detect and recognize faces in real-time to mark attendance. 
<br>=> Attendance Management – View, import, export, and reset attendance logs. 
<br>=> Developer Info – Show information about the development team. 
<br>=> Help Desk – Contact details and help support.
