# Attendance-System-by-Face-Recognition
An automatic Attendance System using the face recognition system

# PROJECT SUMMARY
<pr>The Facial Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based software application that automates the attendance process using computer vision techniques. It uses a webcam to detect and recognize faces in real-time, matching them against a trained database of student images. On successful recognition, the system logs the student's attendance, including the date and time, into a CSV file and optionally stores it in a MySQL database for further analysis or reporting. <pr/>

<b><pr>The system is built with the following core technologies:<b> 
<br>=> Python as the programming language. 
<br>=> OpenCV for face detection and recognition. 
<br>=> Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). 
<br>=> MySQL for database management. 
<br>=> Pillow (PIL) for image processing. <pr/>
